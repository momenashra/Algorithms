1. Project :
Machine Learning and Deep learning Models for Predicting Sales
2. Project Description
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict sales for retail products based on historical data. The model leverages various features such as product category, location, and time of year.
3. Technologies Used :
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
4. Installation Instructions
  # Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/momenashra/Data_science.git
  # Checkout to task branch (time-series-forecasting)
git checkout time-series-forecasting

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Features :
Predicts future sales based on historical data.

Handles data preprocessing and feature engineering automatically.

Provides performance metrics like MAE for both high and low sales depending on custom metrices .
